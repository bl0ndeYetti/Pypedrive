## Deals

Run in Postman

Deals represent ongoing, lost or won sales to an organization or to a person. Each deal has a monetary value and must be placed in a stage. Deals can be owned by a user, and followed by one or many users. Each deal consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. The custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys. These hashes can be mapped against `DealField.key`. The corresponding label for each such custom field can be obtained from `DealField.name`.

#### Get all deals

![Copy link](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Returns data about all not archived deals.

## Channels

Run in Postman

Channels API allows you to integrate your existing messaging channels into Pipedrive through [Messaging app extension](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/messaging-app-extension). It enables you to manage and interact with the channel’s conversations, participants and messages inside Pipedrive Messaging inbox: get the historical conversation, receive and send new messages. These endpoints are accessible only through **Messengers integration** OAuth scope together with Messaging manifest in building the [Messaging app extension](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/messaging-app-extension).

#### Add a channel

![Copy link](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Adds a new messaging channel, only admins are able to register new channels. It will use the getConversations endpoint to fetch conversations, participants and messages afterward. To use the endpoint, you need to have **Messengers integration** OAuth scope enabled and the Messaging manifest ready for the [Messaging app extension](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/messaging-app-extension).

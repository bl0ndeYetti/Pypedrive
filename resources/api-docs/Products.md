## Products

Run in Postman

Products are the goods or services you are dealing with. Each product can have N different price points - firstly, each product can have a price in N different currencies, and secondly, each product can have N variations of itself, each having N prices in different currencies.

In the context of instatiation, a custom price, quantity, duration and discount can be applied.

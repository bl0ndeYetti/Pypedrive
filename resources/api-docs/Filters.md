## Filters

Run in Postman

Each filter is essentially a set of data validation conditions. A filter of the same kind can be applied when fetching a list of deals, leads, persons, organizations or products in the context of a pipeline. Filters are limited to a maximum of 16 conditions. When applied, only items matching the conditions of the filter are returned. Detailed definitions of filter conditions and additional functionality is not yet available.

#### Get all filters

#### Get all filter helpers

![Copy link](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Returns all supported filter helpers. It helps to know what conditions and helpers are available when you want to [add](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Filters#addFilter) or [update](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Filters#updateFilter) filters. For more information, see the tutorial for [adding a filter](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/adding-a-filter).

#### Add a new filter

![Copy link](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Adds a new filter, returns the ID upon success. Note that in the conditions JSON object only one first-level condition group is supported, and it must be glued with 'AND', and only two second level condition groups are supported of which one must be glued with 'AND' and the second with 'OR'. Other combinations do not work (yet) but the syntax supports introducing them in future. For more information, see the tutorial for [adding a filter](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/adding-a-filter).

###### Cost

###### Request

POST

/v1/filters

###### Body parameters

application/json

name

string

required

The name of the filter

conditions

object

required

The conditions of the filter as a JSON object. Please note that a maximum of 16 conditions is allowed per filter and `date` values must be supplied in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. It requires a minimum structure as follows: `{"glue":"and","conditions":[{"glue":"and","conditions": [CONDITION_OBJECTS]},{"glue":"or","conditions":[CONDITION_OBJECTS]}]}`. Replace `CONDITION_OBJECTS` with JSON objects of the following structure: `{"object":"","field_id":"", "operator":"","value":"", "extra_value":""}` or leave the array empty. Depending on the object type you should use another API endpoint to get `field_id`. There are five types of objects you can choose from: `"person"`, `"deal"`, `"organization"`, `"product"`, `"activity"` and you can use these types of operators depending on what type of a field you have: `"IS NOT NULL"`, `"IS NULL"`, `"<="`, `">="`, `"<"`, `">"`, `"!="`, `"="`, `"LIKE '$%'"`, `"LIKE '%$%'"`, `"NOT LIKE '$%'"`. To get a better understanding of how filters work try creating them directly from the Pipedrive application.

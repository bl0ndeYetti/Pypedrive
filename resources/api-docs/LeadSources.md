## LeadSources

Run in Postman

A lead source indicates where your lead came from. Currently, these are the possible lead sources: `Manually created`, `Deal`, `Web forms`, `Prospector`, `Leadbooster`, `Live chat`, `Import`, `Website visitors`, `Workflow automation`, and `API`. Lead sources are pre-defined and cannot be edited. Please note that leads sourced from the Chatbot feature are assigned the value `Leadbooster`. Please also note that this list is not final and new sources may be added as needed.

#### Get all lead sources

![Copy link](<Base64-Image-Removed>)
